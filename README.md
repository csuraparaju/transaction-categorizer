## Tips for Efficient Categorization

- **Start with larger amounts** - Sort by amount (highest first) to tackle the big-ticket items
- **Use search** - Type restaurant names, stores, or locations to find similar transactions
- **Filter by uncategorized** - Focus only on transactions you haven't categorized yet
- **Look for patterns** - Group dinners, shared Ubers, joint grocery trips, etc.
